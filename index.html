		<h2>Industry Experience</h2>
		<h3><a href="https://edworldo.com">EdWorldo</a></h3>
		<p>
			In June of 2021, my friend came to me with the idea of a new way of using the internet. A very bold claim, and one that 
			is hard to market, but that doesn't mean there is no potential in the idea. Pivoting to a tool for educators to use, we
			spent months grinding away with makeshift solutions trying to get a MVP created. It did it's job but it was not production
			ready. We decided to start over from scratch and create the application with react/typescript and Asp.Net core. Starting
			from scratch forced me to learn about the best practices in web development from online forms. Recently I have been practiceing
			communication and leadership as we have multiple people working for/with us to develop the application
		</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			I have always enjoyed programming, however in prior years my ambition to create something huge was gated
			by my inability to judge both the size of the project as well as my own skill level. However, recently
			I have got to the point where I can handle projects of larger size. The first step was to fix things that had
			been bothering me for months. 
		</p>
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/qwed81/x11-key-remapper">X11 key remapper</a></h3>
		<p>
			After trying out Vim with Linux and i3, I fell in love with how customizable my setup was. The UX was completely
			up to me, which naturally after experimenting I found the perfect keybindings for all applications I was using
			consistently. Tmux, Vim, and even my window manager all had a modification key plus u, i, o, p, [, and ] as the way
			to switch was was on the screen. Which combined very well for an experience that was not only uniform across applications,
			but felt natural to use. The problem? Firefox has no setting for changing keybindings, and extensions that exist only work
			while a webpage is loaded. After months of one application disrespecting my entirely keyboard focused workflow, I knew it had to change.
			But what if there are applications in the future that have the same problem? I needed to go deeper and fix the root of the problem,
			not just firefox. Creating an application to sit between the window manager and the application. A task not trivial with my setup.
			Instead of changing the code for my window manager putting the burdon of maintinace of my fork on me, I decided to make a stand alone
			application with Rust. This way I could call the direct C libraries provided by X11, as well have have the high level syntax and
			memory saftey. While it seems like a small problem, the solution ended being very hacky as there is no easy way to do what I am trying
			to do without proxying the entire keyboard. After spending around 40 hours hacking away, I created a working application
			daily.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/qwed81/browser-boost">Browser Boost</a></h3>
		<p>
			After fixing my Firefox problem my setup was almost perfect, however there was one last hold out. None other than my best
			friend Google. Every time I made a search my process was the same.
			<ol>
				<li>Mod + i opened my browser workspace</li>
				<li>Ctrl + t opened a new tab and focued the search bar</li>
				<li>Type in the search and press enter</li>
				<li>Move the mouse and click on the first result</li>
			</ol>
			Normally not a big deal, but when touching the mouse is not common, it became super noticable. I was wasting minutes a day
			just cliking on the first result. In the same spirit as the key remapper, a general solution is prefered. I created a new
			project called Browser Boost, a Firefox extension available on the mozilla store. It's purpose? Allow me to create scripts
			for commonly used websites. Right now the only one I have created a script for is google, but as I find myself frequenting other
			sites I will add them. J and K to move up and down in results in the spirit of Vim, and "Space" to click on the highlighted link.
			Very simple but very effective, the best kind of application. Finally, the limiting factor is the latency between me and the
			Google servers.

		<h3><a href="https://github.com/qwed81/typing-test-generator">Typing Test Generator</a></h3>
		<p>
			Learning how to touch type vastly improved my experience on the computer. However there is one problem that programmers
			run into, the characters they type are not nearly typed at the same rate as other users. Brackets and other special symbols
			as well as numbers (if you use Vim or other keyboard based editors) are very common. Learning the symbols becomes a pain,
			as custom tests are needed to get even close to the frequency of these characters to learn at a reasonable rate. Therefore
			my solution (as is to most things) is to have a computer fix it. This however ended up being a very simple task as I was
			able to finish it in a couple of hours. It is my most liked project on Github though if that is worth anything ðŸ˜„. The idea is 
			simple, take in an input in the form of a bias file, and output a stream of random characters according to that bias. Therefore
			generating a test with high numbers and symbols as well as low frequency of characters becomes a trivial task no matter the length
		<p>
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/qwed81/tetris-os">Tetris OS</a></h3>
		<p>
			Inspired by a youtube video, I thought it would be a fun experiment to build an operating system that only plays tetris. However my
			laziness made this much harder than it needed to be. I didn't write a memory allocator or drivers to interact with the graphics card
			so it remained in its lowest state, only able to display basic characters in 80x25 area. Therefore my tetris game was made up by
			formating block characters into shapes. The annoying part about writing it is the fact everything had to be fixed size as there was
			not memory allocator resulting in code that is way more complicated than it needed to be.
